<p>Welcome to <em>Code 101 With Python</em>! This book is designed to get you up and running, from learning about variables all the way to building a simple pong game, no coding experience required. We'll cover the basic building blocks of code, along with some basic development skills, and we'll build some small projects together.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-book-works"><a class="header" href="#how-the-book-works">How the Book Works</a></h2>
<p><em>Code 101 With Python</em> is split up into 4 parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intro to Code — this covers the basics of computer history and fundamental code building blocks, as well as a few exercises.</li>
<li>Intro to Development — here, we cover setting up a basic development environment and learn about the various tools programmers use day-to-day.</li>
<li>Basic Development — delving more into packages and methods, as well as building two small projects together!</li>
<li>About Classes — tackling a slightly more complex concept, classes, along with a build of Pong as our final project.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>🚀 These parts are intended to be tackled in order, especially if you've never written code before, so don't skip ahead without reading the previous chapters! We've tried to keep the information in here clean and concise, covering the essentials of how Python works and making sure you learn how to develop programs on your own.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history"><a class="header" href="#a-brief-history">A Brief History</a></h2>
<p>At first, computers were essentially glorified abacuses. Using mechanical parts, people were able to manipulate them to perform large or tedious calculations. However, one major downside of these machines was that they were not suitable for calculations involving many variables, as it would be hard to put together the mechanisms necessary to perform such large calculations. Early mechanical computers were also often unable to perform a variety of calculations, instead being built to solve specific equations.</p>
<p>One solution to these problems was to use <em>digital</em> instead of <em>mechanical</em> mediums. Instead of using physical moving parts, people started using vacuum tubes, which were components able to show an &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; state using electricity. By combining vacuum tubes into computers as big as a room, people were able to create computers such as the Mark I and the ENIAC, which could perform fairly complex calculations, and that were also re-programmable via punch cards or punch tape. The first programmers were able to use punch cards or tape in a labour-intensive process to instruct early computers to do things such as calculate shell firing trajectories. Later advances allowed computers to store calculations to run again later. These &quot;stored programs&quot; were the true beginnings of what we now know as software. Programmers often had to write in &quot;machine code&quot;, which is close to binary, to make computers actually do things.</p>

<h2 id="code-and-languages-today"><a class="header" href="#code-and-languages-today">Code and Languages Today</a></h2>
<p>Today, our computers and code have obviously improved far beyond the ones in the 1900s. We use programming languages to tell our computers what to do, instead of punch tape. Instead of the few programming languages that existed at the time, we now have a wide array of languages, some big and some small. In particular, most programming languages can be placed on a spectrum of low-level to high-level.</p>
<p><strong>Low-level</strong> languages require the programmer to work closely with memory and chips to make things happen. This is often an intensive process, as many code structures must be manually built or defined. However, it also gives the programmer more control over what the program does and how it does it. As a result, code written in more low-level languages is often faster and takes up less memory. Examples of low-level languages include C, C++, and Rust.</p>
<p><strong>High-level</strong> languages abstract most of the complexity of low-level languages away. Instead of worrying about how the code interacts with physical components, the programmer can use shorter, more intuitive commands to direct the computer, and the machine fills in the blanks based on pre-written code. While high-level languages are more friendly and convenient, programs written using them are usually slower and take up more memory than programs in low-level languages since more things are done automatically. Examples of high-level languages include Python and JS.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll be working with Python, as it's a very flexible, multi-purpose language that's both powerful and beginner-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="onto-the-code"><a class="header" href="#onto-the-code">Onto the Code!</a></h2>
<p>Now that you know a bit about the history of computers and code, let's move on to talking about some code basics.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="building-blocks-30-40-mins"><a class="header" href="#building-blocks-30-40-mins">Building Blocks (~30-40 mins)</a></h1>
<h2 id="binary-data-storage-hex-and-memory"><a class="header" href="#binary-data-storage-hex-and-memory">Binary, Data, Storage, Hex, and Memory</a></h2>
<p>Today, computers understand and read data that they receive through binary. Binary is a sequence of <code>0</code>'s and <code>1</code>'s, put together. From apps to videos, the data that these actions produce ultimately boils down to binary. Now, there are a lot of way binary is abstracted, or simplified, to make it easier for humans to read, understand and work with. One of these systems is called hexadecimals, or hex.</p>
<p>In terms of code, every program that you write will be run in the computer's memory, or RAM. So, before we get into some basic code concepts, just remember that the way your program's data gets stored in computer memory can affect certain structures or parts of your code.</p>
<p>Now, without further ado, here are some basic concepts and data structures you'll come across while you code!</p>
<h2 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>Variables are containers that store data for you to use in your code. For example, I created this variable <code>number</code> to have the integer value of <code>3</code>. When I add it to <code>7</code>, what's printed out is <code>10</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">number = 3
print(number + 7)  # output: 10
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a variable to hold a certain value, such as this number, you must assign it to the variable. This is how you create variables. So here's my variable name, and this equals sign assigns the integer <code>7 </code> to this variable. So, this variable will always have the integer value <code>7</code>, if I don't overwrite it. If I assign it again with something else, let's say <code>8</code>, the variable changes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">number = 8
print(number)  # output: 8
</code></pre>
<p>It's now the integer value <code>8</code>. You can see this when I add <code>number</code> and <code>3</code> together, what's printed out is <code>11</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">number = 8
print(number + 3)  # output: 11
</code></pre>
<p>So, variables are containers that store data and you can also overwrite them by reassigning them.</p>
<h2 id="strings"><a class="header" href="#strings">Strings</a></h2>
<p>Strings are data types that store sequences of characters, such as like <code>&quot;hello world&quot;</code>. To create a string in Python, you put quotation marks around the characters you want as strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_string = 'this is some text as a Python string'
</code></pre>
<p>Strings are ordered, which means that characters are stored in a certain sequence. A character's place in this order is called an <strong>index</strong>. The index of the first character of a string is <code>0</code>, the next is <code>1</code>, and so on. For example, in this string &quot;hello world&quot;, the string at index <code>0</code> is &quot;h&quot;. At point <code>6</code>, the string is &quot;w&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_string = 'hello world'
print(my_cool_string[0])  # output: h
print(my_cool_string[6])  # output: w
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to extend or combine a string together, in python you can use the <code>+</code> sign. If you want to extend the current string that you have, you can use the <code>+=</code> sign.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_string = 'hello world'
another_string = 'it is I'
a_third_string = my_cool_string + another_string
print(a_third_string)  # output: hello world it is I
my_cool_string += 'it is me'
print(my_cool_string)  # output: hello world it is me
</code></pre>
<p>This also works for numbers too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_number = 42
another_number = 81
a_third_number = my_cool_number + another_number
print(a_third_number)  # output: 123
my_cool_number += 1
print(my_cool_number)  # output: 43
</code></pre>
<h2 id="lists"><a class="header" href="#lists">Lists</a></h2>
<p>Lists are a type of data structure that store data in an ordered way. They are used to store and group data in a list-like form. Lists are very useful if you want to collect or store data that needs to have a specific order.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_list = ['this', 'is', 'a', 'list']
</code></pre>
<p>Each item is a list is known as an <strong>element</strong>. Elements can be strings, integers, variables, etc. For example, if I had the variables <code>s0</code>, <code>s1</code>, and <code>s2</code> in a list called &quot;data&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">s0 = &quot;this is an element&quot;
s1 = &quot;another element!&quot;
s2 = &quot;yet again an element&quot;
data = [s0, s1, s2]
</code></pre>
<p><code>print(data[0])</code> would print <code>s0</code>, <code>print(data[1])</code> would print <code>s1</code>, and <code>print(data[2])</code> would print <code>s2</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">s0 = &quot;this is an element&quot;
s1 = &quot;another element!&quot;
s2 = &quot;yet again an element&quot;
data = [s0, s1, s2]
print(data[0])  # output: this is an element
print(data[1])  # output: another element!
print(data[2])  # output: yet again an element
</code></pre>
<p>Once we get into loops and functions, it'll be easier for you to see how lists can be useful for collecting various types of data.</p>

<p>Dictionaries are a data structures that stores data in key value pairs. What does this mean? Instead of storing data in an order, dictionaries require a key for each piece of data put into it. For example, if I want to put the string &quot;jeb&quot; as a value in a dictionary, I would first have to make a key for it. Let's say this key is the string &quot;reb&quot;. As in, <code>my_cool_dictionary['reb'] = 'jeb'</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_dictionary = {
    &quot;a_cool_key&quot;: 'a cool value'
}
my_cool_dictionary['reb'] = 'jeb'
print(my_cool_dictionary)
# output:
# 
# my_cool_dictionary = {
#     &quot;a_cool_key&quot;: 'a cool value'
#     &quot;reb&quot;: 'jeb'
# }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the useful thing about dictionaries is that they allow you to instantly look up data. For example, if I wanted to access &quot;jeb&quot; in this dictionary, I can just write <code>dict[&quot;reb&quot;]</code>, as if I was look up a definition in the dictionary.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">my_cool_dictionary = {
    &quot;a_cool_key&quot;: 'a cool value'
    &quot;reb&quot;: 'jeb'
}
print(my_cool_dictionary[&quot;reb&quot;])  # output: jeb
</code></pre>
<p>However, as much as possible, you should try not to rely on dictionaries for values that should be ordered.</p>
<h2 id="if-statements"><a class="header" href="#if-statements">If Statements</a></h2>
<p><code>if</code> statements execute code depending on the value of a specific Boolean. A Boolean is a data type that is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>if</code> statement evaluates a boolean to <code>True</code>, it will execute the code it leads to. However, if the <code>if</code> statement evaluates that boolean to <code>False</code>, it will not execute that code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">are_pretzels_good = True
if are_pretzels_good:
    print(&quot;Agreed!&quot;)
    # the above will get run because are_pretzels_good is set to True
</code></pre>
<p><code>if</code> statements can also lead to <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> statements. For example, in this program, if this <code>if</code> statement is False, the program will proceed to the <code>elif</code> statement. If this <code>elif</code> statement is False, it will go to the else statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">are_pretzels_good = False
are_bananas_good = False
if are_pretzels_good:
    print(&quot;Agreed!&quot;)
    # the above won't be run
elif are_bananas_good:
    print(&quot;Alright, fair.&quot;)
    # the above won't be run
else:
    print(&quot;HERETIC&quot;)
    # the above will be run because are_pretzels_good and are_bananas_good are set to False
</code></pre>
<h2 id="loops"><a class="header" href="#loops">Loops</a></h2>
<p>Loops repeat a block of code over and over again. There are two types of loops, <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops. <code>for</code> loops repeat, or iterate, a block of code a certain number of times. In Python, they allow you to iterate (repeat) over data in the order that they appear in. For example, in this <code>for</code> loop, I am iterating over the <code>numbers</code> list, and <code>n</code> is each element in the <code>numbers</code> list in the order they appear in.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 42]
for n in numbers:
    print(n)
# output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 42
</code></pre>
<p><code>for</code> loops are very useful if you want to iterate over data, as you can access the necessary elements and the loop ends after it has iterated over each element once. In this <code>for</code> loop, I am iterating over the <code>numbers</code> list and accessing each element in <code>numbers</code> to add them up in the <code>sum</code> variable before printing it out.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">sum = 0
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 42]
for n in numbers:
    sum += n
print(sum)  # output: 48
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, <code>while</code> loops keep on repeating their nested code as long as the condition you give them evaluates True. So, for example, if I say:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">nums = 0
while nums != 6:
    nums += 1  # this increases the value of nums each time
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop will keep on repeating until <code>nums</code> does equal 6. When <code>nums</code> equals 6, the loop ends. Now, you might ask, doesn't this mean that there are <code>while</code> loops that could be infinite?
And the answer to that is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">while True:
    print(&quot;Pog Champ&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Yes.</p>
<h2 id="operators"><a class="header" href="#operators">Operators</a></h2>
<p>In languages and code, operators are symbols that tells the complier or interpreter (code reader) to perform an operation. For example, the &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; operators in Python will subtract or add integers. The &quot;+&quot; will also concatenate strings and lists. Below is a list of common operators in Python:</p>
<p><code>==</code> \( \rightarrow \) </p>
<h2 id="keywords"><a class="header" href="#keywords">Keywords</a></h2>
<p>Like operators, keywords are words that tells the complier or interpreter (code reader) to perform an operation. For example, <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> are keywords in Python. Below is a list of common keywords in Python:</p>
<h2 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h2>
<p>Functions are blocks of code that are run when they are called. For example, I can create a functions by definining, giving it a name, and writing parameters that the function accepts. Below, you write the program that the function executes. So, when the function is called, it does something to the parameters (data) according to whatever code you wrote. Functions are very useful, as you can create functions to use for various purpose. In this function, sum_it_all_up, you can see that my function takes two lists, breaks them down, and sums them both together and prints the sum. Note that the parameters aren't inherently related to lists in any way, I just treat the parameters like they are lists in my function. Therefore, if parametesr that are not list or are not all integers are passed in the function, an error from the pyhton interpreter will show up.</p>
<p>Python has builtin functions that are very useful and perform basic tasks. Functions are very important in Python, and will help you manipulate data. Here are some fundamental functions for programming in python: </p>

<h2 id="q-which-programming-language-is-the-best"><a class="header" href="#q-which-programming-language-is-the-best">Q: Which programming language is the best?</a></h2>
<p><strong>A: There is no best programming language, only the best for your needs.</strong></p>
<p>Programming languages come in all different types, and whether one is a good choice over another depends on you and what you're using them for. For example, if you're building high-speed servers undergoing heavy traffic, Python might not be your best choice. If you're building a small script to quickly copy filenames, C++ might not be your best choice. In general, do some research about what language is best for what you want to do, and what niches different languages fall in.</p>
<p>Here's a short list of some programming languages and what they're most commonly used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python: very multi-purpose, although its strongest roots lie in scripting, data science, machine learning, and AI.</li>
<li>JavaScript/TypeScript: primarily web development, either web sites or servers, although since web-based technologies are found almost everywhere nowadays you may also find these in other settings. Also used for scripting.</li>
<li>C/C++: primarily more low-level or integrated code, such as desktop apps, libraries, or drivers, although these can be found in a variety of places. Also used a lot for things that need to be fast, such as video games.</li>
<li>Rust: fairly new, operates in a similar niche as C/C++ although its most common uses so far are in command line tools and servers.</li>
<li>Go: also fairly new; multi-purpose, used for servers, command line utilities, and high-performance cloud projects.</li>
<li>Java: used for a variety of things, such as servers, Android apps, games, and desktop apps. Found often in enterprise.</li>
<li>Swift: the most common use of this language is overwhelmingly apps for Apple's platforms, such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch.</li>
<li>C#: general purpose, commonly used for web development, Windows software, and video games using engines like Unity.</li>
<li>Bash/Shell: used primarily for light scripting and automation tasks, usually never any substantially large projects or software.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="q-how-do-programmers-assemble-large-code-projects"><a class="header" href="#q-how-do-programmers-assemble-large-code-projects">Q: How do programmers assemble large code projects?</a></h2>
<p>Although we'll get into this more in Chapters 2 and 3, it's worth noting that developing of larger projects often uses the same basic components as the small pieces of code you've written, just put together in new and different ways. Certain <strong>patterns and principles</strong> are often used to assemble basic building blocks like variables and functions into software that deals with data in a variety of ways. While we won't cover these principles in this book, it's worth exploring some small open-source projects to get a sense of how larger software works, especially if you're interested in a certain field such as desktop apps or game development.</p>

<p>We've finished the first chapter!</p>
<p>In <strong>Intro to Code</strong>, you learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the origin of computers and how code came to be, as well as how languages look
like today</li>
<li>the basic building blocks of code and Python: binary, variables, <code>if</code>
statements, loops, operators, keywords, and functions</li>
<li>basic data structures: strings, integers, booleans, lists, dictionaries</li>
</ul>
<p>We also did a few practice problems together to reinforce your understanding of
these concepts, and talked about debugging as well as some common beginner
questions.</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back! You've learned a lot. In the next chapter, we'll talk
a bit about how developers edit code and work on a project together using the principles from this chapter. Take a break, touch grass, and then click the right arrow at the bottom of the page to move on.</p>

<p>Now that we've gone over the basics of computers and code, we're going to
revisit these concepts in a hands-on way: building a project together. We'll
talk a bit about what developers use to edit code before diving into building a guessing game that incorporates many of the concepts that we covered previously.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-ides"><a class="header" href="#what-are-ides">What are IDES?</a></h2>
<p>You might be used to writing in a word processor, such as Google Docs or Word. People use these applications for writing often because they are the best tool at hand for the job. In the same way, programmers usually write code in a text editor or IDE.</p>
<p>A text editor, quite simply, is software that edits text, which is essentially all a programmer needs to write code. While basic text editors such as Notepad on Windows are technically usable for code, programmers often expect certain features from their text editors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>syntax highlighting:</strong> if you've seen colourful text while looking at code, you know what syntax highlighting is. Colour-coding different types of code statements makes it easier for a programmer to keep track of what's happening.</li>
<li><strong>autocompletion:</strong> having the computer suggest what to write as you're typing code often saves time and prevents errors, such as typos or using the wrong variable.</li>
<li><strong>version control integration:</strong> being able to see what's been changed between different versions of code as they are working allows programmers to keep in mind what's been done before, and whether or not their changes are ideal.</li>
<li><strong>multi-file support:</strong> large software projects often encompass many files, with features spread out across several different sections. The ability to work with multiple files through sidebars, tabs, keybinds, and other features keeps friction low.</li>
</ul>
<p>Text editors that integrate these features are often referred to as IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments. There are many IDEs out there, some free, and some paid, for different programming languages or combinations of languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Features used to differentiate IDEs and text editors have changed over the years as text editors have become more advanced. In this book, we will refer to them mostly interchangeably, although depending on who you ask there are differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next section, we'll talk more about the IDE we'll use in this book and get you set up for a basic project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="installing-all-the-things"><a class="header" href="#installing-all-the-things">Installing all The Things</a></h1>
<p>Here, we'll walk through a quick summary of the IDE we're going to use in this book, as well as getting Python installed and ready on your computer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️  Some of the tools we'll be using may require administrator permissions. They're all safe to install (we use them ourselves, and they're extremely popular tools in the developer community) but it's always good to double-check what you're giving administrator powers to.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="vscode"><a class="header" href="#vscode">VSCode</a></h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code (VSCode for short) is the most popular IDE in the world, according to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment">2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>. We'll be using it in this book, as it is free, light on resources, and useful to beginners and veterans alike.</p>
<p><strong>You can install VSCode from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">here</a>  (if you're on a Chromebook, skip to the <a href="guessing-game/./installing-all-the-things.html#chrome-os">special instructions</a> below)</strong>. When you open it up, it should look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="guessing-game/./assets/vscode-default.png" alt="VSCode's default look." /></p>
<p>VSCode is pretty intuitive (you can always search up &quot;how to do X in VSCode&quot;) but here are some quick tips to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can open folders or files using <code>File &gt; Open</code> or <code>File &gt; Open Folder...</code></li>
<li>Opened files/folders show in the Explorer (first icon in the left sidebar, looks like two pieces of paper)</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-Shift-P</code> (<code>Cmd-Shift-P</code> on macOS) brings up the <strong>Command Palette</strong>, which allows you to quickly search and use VSCode's various features</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-P</code> (<code>Cmd-P</code> on macOS) brings up the <strong>Go To File</strong> menu, which allows you to quickly search and switch to your open files</li>
<li><code>Ctrl-J</code> (<code>Cmd-J</code> on macOS) brings up the <strong>Terminal</strong> window. We'll cover what this does in a minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, you don't need to do anything with VSCode, unless you want to play with it a bit. We'll be using it more in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="installing-python"><a class="header" href="#installing-python">Installing Python</a></h2>
<p>You'll also need to install Python so that you can actually run Python code on your computer! <strong>You can find the latest version of Python <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/">here</a> (find your OS at the bottom of the page: &quot;Windows installer (64-bit)&quot;, &quot;macOS 64-bit universal2 installer&quot;)</strong>. When you open up the installer, it should prompt you with some instructions and ask you to accept a license agreement before installing. There are also some OS-specific instructions for installing Python below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️  If you've already installed Python, make sure it is up-to-date so you can follow along with this guide. 3.10 or newer is preferred, although any version of Python newer than 3.8 should be fine. Check the OS-specific instructions as well so that you can make sure your Python install works as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="windows"><a class="header" href="#windows">Windows</a></h3>
<p>The Microsoft Store offers a version of Python 3; however, we don't recommend using it because of some edge-case compatibility issues. Use the install instructions provided above.</p>
<p>On Windows, the Python installer should show a window like this:</p>
<p><img src="guessing-game/./assets/python-wizard-windows.png" alt="Python wizard on Windows" /></p>
<p>It's important that you check the boxes exactly as shown in the pictures above as that will allow you to follow along with the book with no issues. Then, click the &quot;Install Now&quot; button to install Python!</p>
<p>You'll also need to go into Settings and disable the Python options under <strong>Manage Execution Aliases</strong> (search &quot;manage execution aliases&quot; in Settings):</p>
<p><img src="guessing-game/./assets/windows-aliases-off.png" alt="Windows aliases off" /></p>
<h3 id="macos"><a class="header" href="#macos">macOS</a></h3>
<p>macOS actually comes with a version of Python; however, it's missing a few features and is usually not up to date, so we recommend installing it manually anyway.</p>
<h3 id="chrome-os"><a class="header" href="#chrome-os">Chrome OS</a></h3>
<p>We don't have a Chromebook to test out Python and VSCode installs. However, the reputable Codecademy has put out some instructions on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/programming-locally-on-chromebook">enabling Linux support</a> (required for installing these kinds of tools) and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/programming-python-on-chromebook">installing Python and VSCode</a> which should work fine.</p>

<h2 id="safety-check"><a class="header" href="#safety-check">Safety Check</a></h2>
<p>To check whether all of your installs work as expected, open up VSCode and use <code>Ctrl-j</code>/<code>Cmd-j</code> to open it up in VSCode:</p>
<p><img src="guessing-game/./assets/vscode-with-terminal.png" alt="VSCode with the terminal open" /></p>
